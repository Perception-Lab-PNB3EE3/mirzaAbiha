In the folder "MyExperiment" there are two folders: "img" and "jsPsych". The "img" folder contains all the images that you will see when you run the experiment on your web. The "jsPsych" folder contains all of the plugins necessary to code and run the experiment. There are 3 files: myNewExperiment, "reactiontut", and "hello_world". The "hello_world" file uses the html-keyboard-response plugin to run a simple trial. When you open the web browser you will see the "Hello world!" script and all you have to do is click a button on your keyboard to end the trial. The "reactiontut" file runs an experiment that tests for the reaction time of the participant. When you open the file in your web browser instructions will show up explaining which key you must click when you see a specific stimulus. Then you press any key on your keyboard to start the trial. The trials will be a series of orange or blue circles with a fixation cross in the middle. Once you have completed all the trials you will be shown your reaction time, accuracy rate and instructions on how to end the experiment. The "myNewExperiment" file does the same as the previous file however this time the orange circle is much smaller during the trials. The blue circle is now replaced with a blue square and in the final page you are told whether or not your reaction time was good, if it could be better, or if it was bad.
