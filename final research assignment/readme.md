In the folder "final research assignment" there is one folder called "jsPsych". The "jsPsych" folder contains all of the plugins necessary to code and run the experiment. There is also one file labelled "research experiment" which uses the html-keyboard-response, html-button-response, survey-likert, and survey-multi-choice plugins to run the experiment. The "research experiment" file runs an experiment that tests the perception of microaggression severity in different individuals. When you open the web browser you will first see a welcome page created using the html-keyboard-response. By clicking any key you will be directed to the consent page. This page uses the html-button-response where you must click the continue button to move to the next page. Then you will be shown a series of scenarios that you have to read followed by likert scale questions that must be answered. This was run using the jsPsych survey-likert plugin. Finally you will be directed to a demographic survey where the jspsych survey-multi-choice plugin was used to create questions that participants must answer.
