# Study Information 

## 1. Title 
Effect of developmental environment (multicultural vs. homogenous society) on the perception of microaggression severity. 

## 2. Authors 
Abiha Mirza

## 3. Description 
  Racial discrimination has existed in North America for centuries, from the time of slavery to more recent events like 9/11. When racism is discussed, people often assume it refers to overt hate crimes or slurs. However, racism can also take more subtle forms, appearing in workplaces, schools, and healthcare settings across North America. Microaggressions are subtle verbal or nonverbal exchanges that express bias toward a minority group, whether intentionally or unintentionally (@sue2007) . These can occur through face-to-face interactions or environmental cues, such as workplace decorations that may alienate or offend marginalized individuals. @sue2007 categorized microaggressions into three types: microassaults, microinsults, and microinvalidations. Microassaults are verbal or nonverbal attacks intended to harm the target. Microinsults are subtle comments or behaviors that are offensive and that reinforce negative stereotypes. Microinvalidations are when racial experiences of a person are dismissed. These three types of microaggressions indicate different levels of severity. Understanding these different forms of microaggressions is critical, as they can have significant implications for mental health (@martins_lima_santos_2020). Research indicates that microaggressions negatively impact the psychological and emotional well-being of non-White individuals (@forrest-bank2015). More importantly, microaggressions can create barriers in therapist-client relationships, discouraging individuals from seeking the care they need (@sue2007). A more recent study found that experiencing microaggressions in healthcare settings can shape patients’ long-term perceptions of the medical system, further disrupting their willingness to seek treatment (@punches2023). Therefore, understanding microaggressions can have broader implications in the healthcare field and for patient-physician interactions.  

  The theory of intergroup contact, first developed by Gordon Allport, suggests that positive intergroup interactions can reduce prejudice under four conditions: equal status, intergroup cooperation, shared goals, and support from institutional authorities (@allport1954). However, @Pettigrew1998 later revised this theory, identifying limitations such as its lack of attention to process and generalization. His longitudinal intergroup contact theory emphasizes that sustained intergroup contact can reduce prejudice over time, even in the absence of all four optimal conditions. Applying this to microaggressions, individuals who grow up with diverse social experiences and cross-group friendships may be less likely to perceive microaggressions as severe or may interpret them differently. However, little research has explored how early intergroup contact influences perceptions of microaggression severity.

  This study aims to address the gap by examining how individuals raised in multicultural societies, with frequent intergroup interactions, perceive microaggressions compared to those from homogeneous societies, where intergroup contact is limited. Specifically, we will investigate whether individuals from multicultural backgrounds are more or less likely to recognize and rate microaggressions as severe. Several studies have understood that microaggressions have a subjective nature and may be perceived differently according to certain individual factors. Prior research has found that factors such as political beliefs, educational background, and personal experience with discrimination influence how individuals perceive them (@williams2016, @Boysen2012, @jenkins2023, @@offerman2013) . For example, @williams2016 found that people of color who had personally experienced racial microaggressions were more likely to perceive racially themed memes as offensive than White individuals with no similar experiences. However, both groups rated racial memes as more offensive than non-racial ones. @Boysen2012 found that teachers who taught diversity-focused courses were more likely to perceive racial microaggressions as harmful and intervene compared to teachers of other subjects. Similarly, @jenkins2023 found that individuals with left-leaning political orientations tended to perceive microaggressions as more severe. Additionally, people of color who strongly identified with their racial group, rated microaggressions as more harmful (@jenkins2023). Finally, a study run by @offerman2013 looked at discrimination in the workplace. They found that a supervisor’s reputation in the workplace can influence an employee's perception on the microaggression severity. If the supervisor had a reputation for equity and fairness, microaggressions were perceived less severe. These findings suggest that an individual’s background and context of the situation can shape perceptions of microaggressions. This is important in healthcare settings as well as educational and workplace contexts as the perceptions of microaggressions can contribute to how a person of color is treated relative to others, and it may determine whether their concerns are heard and addressed. We will further explore the factors that contribute to this difference in microaggression severity perception to further break barriers and ensure fair treatment of all individuals. 

## 4. Hypotheses 
If growing up in a homogenous vs. multicultural society affects the perception of the severity of a microaggression towards a marginalized group, then the mean for the severity rating of the microaggression will be higher for those who grew up in multicultural societies. This is because they will be have been exposed to more interactions with a diverse group of people and be more aware of microaggressions. 

# Design Plan 

## 5. Study type 

> **Experiment** - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.

## 6. Blinding 

- [ ] No blinding is involved in this study.

- [x] For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned.

- [ ] Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments. (Commonly known as “double blind”)

- [ ] Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the treatment applied to any given group.

## 7. Is there any additional blinding in this study? 

This will be a web-designed study therefore there will be limited interaction with the participants. They will not know the different conditions that exist or which one they are in. The researcher will know which condition is which when analyzing the data but not which individual the data comes from. 

## 8. Study design 
This study will be a 2*3 mixed factorial design. The two independent variables are: developmental environment (multicultural vs. homogenous), and microaggression type (normal interaction - control, microinvalidation, microinsult).
Developmental environment (multicultural vs. homogenous) is a between-subjects factor because it is a factor that cannot be changed about the individuals.
Microaggression type (normal interaciton, microinvalidation, microinsult) is a within-subjects factor (each participant experiences all three conditions).
In total there are two independent variables and 5 levels.

Racial background has been omitted as a major factor to simplify the study design, but it will still be noted in the demographic survey and assessed for differences in the perception of microaggression severity. 

Participants will read a series of AI generated vignettes, depicting microaggression. Most previous studies that have explored perceptions on microaggressive behaviors have used vignettes to present scenarios to the observers. 
The vignettes will be as follows: 
  Maria, a Latina professional, shares with her coworker Ashley that she has struggled to get interviews at certain companies. "I feel like sometimes my last name makes employers hesitate," Maria says.

  Ashley immediately shakes her head and laughs. "No way! Companies don’t care about that stuff anymore. It’s all about skills now."

  Maria presses her lips together and replies, "I don’t know... I’ve noticed a pattern." Ashley shrugs, "I think you might be overthinking it. I’m sure it’s just bad luck."

  Maria nods, but the conversation leaves her feeling dismissed.
  
The participants will then have to rate the severity of each microaggression using a likert scale. Three scales will be used to measure this: 
- The behavior depicted in the vignette was highly offensive: 1 = strongly disagree, 10 = strongly agree
- The person meant to behave in a racially insensitive manner: 1= strongly disagree, 10 =  strongly agree
- I would step in and say something to stop the interaction: 1 = strongly disagree, 10 = strongly agree

Because of the nature of the characteristics that the participants are grouped by, there is no possible way to do a within subjects design, although a within subjects design would help control for individual differences. Instead there will be a survey after the experiment asking questions about their background, things related to: 
- political beliefs
- previous experience with discrimination 
- age
- where did they grow up/where do they currently live
- education on topics of diversity and microaggressions
- prior exposure to diversity 

All participants will be asked to answer all the questions and read all the vignettes, however participants may choose to omit certain questions or withdraw from the study at any point, but this data will then be discarded. 

Counterbalancing will be needed in terms of which vignette each participant reads first. We will randomize the order of the videos for each participant. This is because One video may appear to be a more severe microaggression and could result in participants rating the next video with a lower severity score because of order effects. 

## 9. Randomization 
All participants will experience each condition therefore no randomization will be needed for the specific conditions however counterbalancing will be required. 

# Sampling Plan 
> In this section we'll ask you to describe how you plan to collect samples, as well as the number of samples you plan to collect and your rationale for this decision. Please keep in mind that the data described in this section should be the actual data used for analysis, so if you are using a subset of a larger dataset, please describe the subset that will actually be used in your study.

## 10. Existing data 

-   [x] Registration prior to creation of data: As of the date of submission of this research plan for preregistration, the data have not yet been collected, created, or realized.
-   [ ] Registration prior to any human observation of the data: As of the date of submission, the data exist but have not yet been quantified, constructed, observed, or reported by anyone - including individuals that are not associated with the proposed study. Examples include museum specimens that have not been measured and data that have been collected by non-human collectors and are inaccessible.
-   [ ] Registration prior to accessing the data: As of the date of submission, the data exist, but have not been accessed by you or your collaborators. Commonly, this includes data that has been collected by another researcher or institution.
-   [ ] Registration prior to analysis of the data: As of the date of submission, the data exist and you have accessed it, though no analysis has been conducted related to the research plan (including calculation of summary statistics). A common situation for this scenario when a large dataset exists that is used for many different studies over time, or when a data set is randomly split into a sample for exploratory analyses, and the other section of data is reserved for later confirmatory data analysis.
-   [ ] Registration following analysis of the data: As of the date of submission, you have accessed and analyzed some of the data relevant to the research plan. This includes preliminary analysis of variables, calculation of descriptive statistics, and observation of data distributions. Please see cos.io/prereg for more information.

## 11. Explanation of existing data 
I will not be using existing data.

## 12. Data collection procedures 
Participants will be recruited through advertisements on social media and prolific. Participants will be paid $10 for agreeing to participate. Participants must be:
- Be at least 18 years old
- Lived in either a predominantly multicultural or homogenous environment for at least 10 years 
- Be sufficiently fluent in English (it does not have to be their first language)
Recruitment advertisements will send those who are interested to a screening questionnaire that will confirm their eligibility. This questionnaire will ask questions regarding the participants age, current area of residence, the area of residence they grew up in and what their first language is. 
Those who fit the criteria will be emailed the instructions and information to participate in the web-based experiment. 

## 13. Sample size 
Our target sample size is a minimum of 30 participants for each level of the developmental environment. We will try and recruit up to 50 per condition, for a total of 100 participants. This is assuming that not all will complete the task and that a higher sample size will provide us with a greater chance of seeing a significant difference.


## 14. Sample size rationale 
We used the software program G\*Power to conduct a power analysis. Our goal was to obtain .95 power to detect a medium effect size of .09 using partial eta-squared at the standard .05 alpha error probability.The effect size estimate was obtained through the study run by @williams2016. They found a main effect for racial group' ratings of the offensiveness of memes. 
However without any limitations involved we used the software program  G\*Power and we obtained N= 30. Therefore in order to obtain a significant effect with 95% power we need at least 30 participants per group. However, more participants will be collected to account for individual differences, dropouts, and outliers. 

## 15. Stopping rule 
We will post 20 participant sign-up slots on the Monday of each week. If by the following Monday we have not reached the target recruitment size of 100 (50/group) we will open up another 20 slots. 
As soon as one category fills up, for example we have enough participants for the homogenous group, then we will change the requirements for the recruitment to fulfill the remaining condition and recruit participants. 

# Variables 

> In this section you can describe all variables (both manipulated and measured variables) that will later be used in your confirmatory analysis plan. In your analysis plan, you will have the opportunity to describe how each variable will be used. If you have variables which you are measuring for exploratory analyses, you are not required to list them, though you are permitted to do so.

## 16. Manipulated variables 
The primary manipulated variable is the microaggression type. A vignette depicting a regular interaction with no intent of harm will be the control. The two other conditions will be a vignettes depicting a microinsult and another depicting a microinvalidation. The other variable will be the society in which the individual grows up in, either the multicultural or the homogenous society. 

## 17. Measured variables 
The measured variable will be the perceived severity of microagressions. Three scales will be used to measure this: 
- The behavior depicted in the vignette was highly offensive: 1 = strongly disagree, 10 = strongly agree
- The person meant to behave in a racially insensitive manner: 1= strongly disagree, 10 =  strongly agree
- I would step in and say something to stop the interaction: 1 = strongly disagree, 10 = strongly agree


## 18. Indices 
We will take the mean of the three questions related to the severity of the microaggression to create a single measure of "microagression severity".


# Analysis Plan 

> You may describe one or more confirmatory analysis in this preregistration. Please remember that all analyses specified below must be reported in the final article, and any additional analyses must be noted as exploratory or hypothesis generating.
>
> A confirmatory analysis plan must state up front which variables are predictors (independent) and which are the outcomes (dependent), otherwise it is an exploratory analysis. You are allowed to describe any exploratory work here, but a clear confirmatory analysis is required.


## 19. Statistical models 
We will use a 2*3 mixed factorial ANOVA. 
Independent variables include the types of microaggressions (3 levels: normal interaction, microinvalidation, microinsult). This is within subjects. We decided to focus on microinvalidations and microinsults rather than microassaults because the former two are subtle forms of microaggression. The other independent variable is developmental environment (2 levels: multicultural vs. homogenous). This variable is between subjects. 
The dependent variable is the perceived severity of microaggression, measured through likert scales. 
We will mostly focus on the main effect of developmental environment on the perception of the severity of microaggressions. But we will also pay attention to any interactions that stand out in the results. 

If a significant interaction is found then post-hoc bonferroni t-tests will be conducted to see where the significance lies. 
Partial eta squared will be used to determine the effect size of any significant main effects or interactions. 

We will be using a p-value of 0.05 to determine significance. 


## 20. Transformations 
The perception of the severity of a microaggression does not require additional transformations. 

## 21. Inference criteria 
We will use the standard p\<.05 criteria for determining if the ANOVA and the post hoc test suggest that the results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis were correct. The post-hoc bonferroni tests correct for multiple comparisons. 

## 22. Data exclusion 
Responses will be excluded if participants do not complete the study. All other responses will be taken into consideration. Outliers will be included in the analysis. 
An awareness check will be used mid-way through the study, if participants fail the awareness check, they will be excluded from the study. 


## 23. Missing data 
If a subject does not complete any of the three indices for the perception of microaggression severity or fails the awareness checks, the subject will be removed from the analysis. 

## 24. Exploratory analysis 
Some additional analyses may take place because demographic traits (age, education, experiences) may be related to the perception of severity. Therefore, we will look for relationships between the demographic variables and the primary outcome measure of microaggression severity perception.
